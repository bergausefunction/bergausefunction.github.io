Finally ,I decide to write something about my work and life.It takes me much time to set up a github.io and maybe need to spend much time on MarkDown.

## Motivation
Recently ,I got a task that analysis the work results of other ppl. I learn a lot from them and I find it's a good way to improve myself. So ,why not write down them and make them as good references.

## Purpose
It's also a good chance to wirte something about my life, so ,maybe you will find many journals .Actually ,I want to invite my friends to write something in this blog ,as simple as possible , to introduce our different work.

## nothing,just test how to put picture and code

![xhr](../img/xhr.jpeg)
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	return 1;
}
```
